# HR-Analytics

### Project Overview
Welcome to our HR Analytics project, where we delve into various data points related to employee management. Within this analysis, we focus on key metrics such as the total number of employees, attrition count, and active employees. Additionally, we explore factors including the average age of employees, attrition rates across different departments, age brackets, gender distributions, and levels of employee job satisfaction. Through this comprehensive examination, we aim to gain valuable insights into workforce dynamics and enhance strategic decision-making processes within the organization.

### Data Sources
We have taken the data from the below file for data analysis purpose.

### Tools
- Csv
- Power BI

### Data Cleaning and Data Transformation
Data cleaning has been conducted by ensuring appropriate data types are assigned to each column and by eliminating any duplicate entries.
We have converted columns like Attrition (with values "Yes/No") and Gender (with values "Male/Female") into numerical representations of 1 and 0. Additionally, for columns like age bands, we're sorting them using conditional criteria. Furthermore, we're separating employee numbers from "Staff-1" to simply "1," and we have created new measures such as Active Employees and Attrition Rate for visual presentation on dashboard.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs).
2. Calculating the percentage of attrition within each department.
3. Analyzing the distribution of employees across different age groups.
4. Evaluating job satisfaction levels based on job roles.
5. Determining the attrition rates across different fields.
6. Examining the distribution of attrition by age and gender.
7. Investigating the distribution of attrition across various fields based on the education background of employees.
